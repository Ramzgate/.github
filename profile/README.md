### The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Framework
A private sector initiative led by the _American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)_, _Institute of Management Accountants (IMA)_, _American Accounting Association (AAA)_, _Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)_, and _Financial Executives International (FEI)_.

 It is a widely recognized and comprehensive internal control framework used by organizations to assess, design, and implement effective internal controls. 
 
 It provides guidance on risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring to help organizations achieve their objectives and enhance their overall performance.

The basic principles of the COSO framework are as follows:

1. __Internal Control Environment__: Establish a positive and supportive internal control culture throughout the organization, including clear ethical values, integrity, and a commitment to competence.

2. __Risk Assessment__: Identify and assess the risks that may affect the achievement of organizational objectives. This involves understanding potential risks and their potential impact on the organization's performance.

3. __Control Activities__: Implement control activities that mitigate identified risks and ensure that policies, procedures, and processes are in place to effectively address those risks.

4. __Information and Communication__: Communicate relevant information to appropriate stakeholders to support effective internal control. This includes timely and accurate reporting to management and other relevant parties.

5. __Monitoring Activities__: Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure they are functioning as intended and identify any necessary improvements.

These principles collectively form the foundation for the COSO framework and guide organizations in establishing a robust and reliable internal control system to achieve their objectives and enhance overall performance.

### The System and Organization Controls (SOC) Framework 

A set of guidelines established by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) to assess and report on the effectiveness of an organization's _controls_ over _financial reporting_ and other relevant operational aspects. It is designed to provide assurance to stakeholders, such as customers and business partners, regarding the _security_, _availability_, _processing integrity_, _confidentiality_, and _privacy_ of systems and data handled by service organizations. SOC reports are commonly used by organizations to demonstrate their commitment to maintaining strong controls and security measures to protect sensitive information and operations.
