# Ramzgate

The _Ramzgate controls_ initiative aims to develop [_internal controls_](https://github.com/Ramzgate/.github/blob/main/profile/Controls.md) for web3 within the [_COSO_](https://github.com/Ramzgate/.github/blob/main/profile/Controls.md) framework. Our team is actively working on innovative technology to enable continuous monitoring and auditing of blockchains and smart contracts. Through this technology, we seek to provide unparalleled levels of safety and protection, surpassing the current standards in the financial world. Our focus is on harnessing the potential of blockchain technology to deliver advanced monitoring and extraction capabilities, ensuring enhanced security and trust in decentralized systems.

## Our Mission
Ramzgate's mission is to ensure the safe and secure access to decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing technology and expertise to identify, measure, mitigate, and offset risks. Our goal is to set industry standards for risk control and management, making internal controls accessible to all market participants. We strive to foster a safer and more reliable DeFi environment, promoting widespread adoption of effective risk management practices.
